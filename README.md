#Real-Time Sign Language Translation System
##Overview
In virtual environments, communication barriers exist for individuals who rely on sign language, limiting their ability to interact effectively with others who do not understand sign language. Our solution is a real-time sign language translation system that leverages machine learning and computer vision technologies to bridge this communication gap.
This system recognizes sign language gestures and translates them into spoken or written language in real-time, enhancing accessibility and enabling inclusive communication within the metaverse. Users who rely on sign language can now fully engage and participate in virtual interactions.
